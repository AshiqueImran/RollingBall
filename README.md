# Rolling Ball Game
*Rolling Ball Game* is a gaming app with some basic functionalities where a ball is rolling on a street. A user needs to just avoid the car shaped obstacles coming randomly from the opposite side and save the ball. There are several ways to move the ball like jump up, go forward, go backward, move left- right. The user will lose the life if the rolling ball collides with the obstacles. **At the primary stage all the instructions will be displayed when the collision will not be counted**.
